A Delphi decompiler is a tool that can convert a Delphi executable file into a more readable form, such as assembly code or pseudo-code. This can help you understand how the application works, find bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, or add new features.
  
However, most Delphi decompilers are not free or easy to use. Some of them require a license key or registration, while others have limited functionality or compatibility. That's why some people look for a cracked version of a Delphi decompiler that can bypass these restrictions and offer more features.
  
One of the most popular Delphi decompilers is **Delphi Decompiler Full Crack 14**, which is based on the original [Delphi Decompiler v1.1.0.194 (Remastered)](https://forum.ragezone.com/threads/development-delphi-decompiler-v1-1-0-194-remastered.1194080/) by BitMaker and Nemesis [^1^]. This tool claims to support all Delphi versions from Delphi 2 to Delphi XE5, and to be able to decompile DCU files, BPL files, DLL files, and EXE files into Pascal code.
