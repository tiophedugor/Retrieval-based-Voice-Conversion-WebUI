# Tom, Dick and Harry: A Comedy of Errors
 
Tom, Dick and Harry is a 2006 Indian comedy film directed by Deepak Tijori and starring Dino Morea, Jimmy Sheirgill, Anuj Sawhney, Celina Jaitly and Kim Sharma. The film follows the misadventures of three disabled friends - deaf Tom, blind Dick and dumb Harry - who get involved in a kidnapping plot involving two beautiful girls and a ton of cash[^4^]. The film is a remake of the 1941 Hollywood film of the same name, which starred Ginger Rogers, George Murphy, Alan Marshal and Burgess Meredith[^5^]. The film was a moderate success at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.
 
The film begins with Tom (Dino Morea), a deaf car mechanic who falls in love with Celina (Celina Jaitly), a rich girl who is engaged to a businessman named Soprano (Gulshan Grover). Tom tries to woo Celina with the help of his friend Happy Singh (Rakesh Bedi), but ends up getting into trouble with Soprano's goons. Meanwhile, Dick (Jimmy Sheirgill), a blind radio jockey who hosts a show called "Love Line", receives a call from Bijlee (Kim Sharma), a dancer who wants to elope with her lover. Dick agrees to help her, but soon realizes that she is actually Soprano's mistress and that he has been duped into becoming an accomplice in her kidnapping. Finally, Harry (Anuj Sawhney), a dumb waiter who works at a restaurant owned by Inspector Waghmare (Shakti Kapoor), meets Hansa (Payal Rohatgi), a rich girl who is running away from her marriage. Harry falls for her and decides to help her escape from her family.

The three friends end up at the same hotel where Bijlee is being held captive by Soprano's men. They manage to rescue her and escape with the ransom money, but are chased by Soprano, Waghmare and Hansa's family. They also encounter Himesh Reshammiya (playing himself), who gives them a lift in his car. The film ends with a series of comic twists and turns that reveal the true identities and motives of the characters.

The film also has a sequel, titled Tom, Dick and Harry 2, which is scheduled to release in 2021. The sequel is directed by Deepak Tijori and stars Jimmy Sheirgill, Pooja Chopra and Sanjay Dutt in the lead roles[^1^]. The sequel follows the adventures of the three friends after they get married and have children. The film is expected to be a comedy of errors involving their families and their new problems.

According to the director, the sequel will have a different storyline and tone from the original film. He said, "The first part was a situational comedy where the three friends were deaf, blind and dumb. The second part is more of a family comedy where they have grown up and have kids. The kids are also deaf, blind and dumb. So it's a double dose of comedy." He also revealed that Sanjay Dutt will play a pivotal role in the film as a gangster who becomes their friend[^1^].
 
The film was announced in 2016 and was supposed to release in 2017, but was delayed due to various reasons. The film faced some legal issues as well, as the producer of the original film filed a case against Tijori for using the same title without his permission. The case was later settled out of court and the film was allowed to proceed with its production[^1^]. The film is currently in its post-production stage and is expected to hit the screens soon.
